# bioinformatics-hw1

The point of this exercise is to review some of the introductory concepts in molecular biology that we covered in the first few lectures, as well as to become somewhat familiar with the breadth and depth of the information available in various on-line genomic databases. You will do this by investigating six genes: {SLC6A20, LZTFL1, CCR9, CXCR6, FYCO1 and XCR1} which are found to be responsible for respiratory failures in the COVID-19 cases (Links to an external site.).

Start from the NCBI Human Genome Page. (Links to an external site.)

1. Where each of the six genes are located?
    * Please specify the chromosome number and describe the position (starting & end positions) of the gene on the chromosome.
    * Specify which are located on the positive strand, which are on the negative strand.

2. How many genes are on this chromosome, considering all of the six genes are located on a single chromosome?

Now look at this Genbank record (Links to an external site.) which is a hand-curated "reference" sequence derived from several Genbank entries. This record shows the DNA sequence that corresponds to the mRNA sequence after splicing. The "CDS" entry in the list of features indicates the subsequence of this gene that is translated into protein.

3. How many amino acids are in the encoded protein?

4. What are the first three code words (i.e., codons) in the gene, and what is the amino acid encoded by each one?

5. What are the last three code words (i.e., codons) in the gene, and what is the amino acid (if any) encoded by each one?

6. How many bases are in the 5' untranslated region (the part of the mRNA before the start codon)?

   Now go to the entry for the translated  protein, NP_001373364.1 (Links to an external site.)

7. In which part of the cell (site) is the protein found?


Now, go to the UniProt protein knowledgebase entry: O00574 (Links to an external site.) (https://www.uniprot.org/uniprot/O00574).

8. List the known GO:BP (i.e., Gene Ontology Biological Processes) this CXCR6 protein is associated with.


Now, go to the main OMIM entry for Immunodeficiency (Links to an external site.). OMIM is a hand-curated database that characterizes associations between particular genes and disorders. As you have surely gathered by now, six genes are so far known to be associated with respiratory failure. 

1. Can you find which one also takes part in the immunodeficiency in some other organisms?


The following exercises are multiple choices. Each question may have more than one correct answers. Please make your choice(s). 
              
10. Questions on cell structures of eukaryotes:
    
    a. DNA usually exists in the nucleus.
    b. A small amount of DNA exists in the mitochondrion.
    c. DNA passes through the nuclear pore into the cytoplasm.
    d. None of them above.

11. DNA structure:

    a. DNA is a polymer composed of nucleotides with bases A, T, C and G.
    b. DNA is a double helix structure with each strand consisting of peptide backbone.
    c. The 5’ end of DNA has a free hydroxyl group while the 3’ end has an unlinked  phosphate group.
    d. For RNA, uracil (U) is used in place of thymine (T).

12.  Gene questions:

    a. A gene is any sequence of nucleotides and is unit of hereditary information.
    b. Muscle cells differ from nerve cells because they contain different genes.
    c. Our eye colors are different is because the genes that determine our eye colors are different.
    d. None of the above questions is correct.

13.  For Eukaryotes and Prokaryotes,
    
    a. Prokaryotes do not have a membrane-bound nucleus.
    b. Examples of prokaryotes are bacteria and yeast.
    c. During the protein synthesis process, both of their mRNA need to go through the splicing process before the translation takes place.
    d. None of them above.
 
14.  Code words, codons, and anti-codons:

    a.Anti-codons and code words are complimentary to each other.
    b. Code words and codons are complimentary to each other.
    c. Anti-codons are contained by rRNA which is synthesized in the nucleus.
    d. The codons for amino acid tryptophan are not the same in a bacterium, an amoeba, a plant or a human being.
 
15.  Central dogma of molecular biology:
    
    a. Transcription takes place whenever RNA polymerase shows up in the nucleus.
    b. Either of the two polynucleotide chains can be used to form two different mRNA  molecules.
    c. After splicing, the expression regions are called introns which will later code protein synthesis.
    d. Proteins are synthesized on the surface of ribosomes.
